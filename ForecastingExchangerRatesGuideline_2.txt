1)Data
1.1)8 major currencies: USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, CNY (ready)
1.2)short-term interest rates for those countries (monthly rate ready)
1.3)stock market indices for those countries (ready)
1.4)gold prices (ready)
1.5)oil prices (ready)
1.6)CPI index (ready)
...
period: 1/1999-2/2021
frequency: daily, weekly, monthly(easier to find)


2)Models (only USD to other currencies)
Random forest (Brian)
XGboost (Binnie)
SVM (MAU)
ANN ()
Temporal CNN ()
LSTM (univariate) (for daily prediction only)(but the data is limited) ()
linear regression (for daily prediction only) ()
...

Advanced model:
MTGNN(https://github.com/nnzhan/MTGNN) (Tony)

more challenging:
build our own model

3)measurement metrics 
RMSE
MAE
MAPE
R^2
DM test

4)Construct long-short portfolios
long the top 3, short the bottom 3 for each model to see the return.
